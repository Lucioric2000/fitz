Fitz: an fMRI Analysis Ecosystem
=================================

Fitz expands on Lyman to provide a true ecosystem; instead of wrapping a
single and static processing stream, Fitz provides many of the wrappings that
lyman created in a way that allows people to spend their time running
reproducible pipelines instead of messing around with grabbing data.
