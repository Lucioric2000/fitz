Fitz: Modern Nipype Workflow Management
========================================

Fitz provides an interface to reproducibly manage and execute custom nipype
workflows for the analysis of neuroimaging experiments. It expands on the
`Lyman`_ "ecosystem" to allow workflows to be easily plugged into the lyman
interface.

Fitz provides many of the wrappings that lyman created in a way that allows
people to spend their time running reproducible pipelines instead of messing
around re-writing boilerplate.
