v0.0.1 (July, 2015)
----------------------

Initial release.

What's working:

* Pipelines can be flexibly installed and run.

What's upcoming:

* Maybe switch workflow options to traits instead of simple python variables;
  that might make it easier for users to see what's available.
* Maybe add a requirements file for pipelines to define dependencies.
